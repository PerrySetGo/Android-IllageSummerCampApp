        <string name="aboutCampText"><b>Things to know:</b>
    Illage Summer camp is a queer-founded, community-oriented, ally-supported, unicorn-inspired experience of pure magic. \n\n
        You don\'t need to sign up for an activity, just show up!\n\n
        Respect the Illage community -- treat everyone with love, dignity, and compassion. Honor each other\'s identities and experiences.
        Don\'t make assumptions. Always do your best and be aware of each other. (This rule was written by our fiends at A-Camp)\n\n
        Camp runs on donations. Please bring cash to contribute. No one turned away for lack of funds!
